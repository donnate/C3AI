,Have you taken a COVID-19 antibody test?,test1,Yes,1,"You took an antibody test, which by itself provides an answer as to whether you have COVID-19 antibodies with a reasonable level of accuracy. However, these tests are not perfectly sensitive or specific, and by answering the other questions in this questionnaire you have improved the accuracy of your diagnosis considerably. "
,Have you taken a COVID-19 antibody test?,test1,No,0,"You didn't take an antibody test, which makes it difficult to predict whether you have had COVID-19. As you will notice, the uncertainty around your diagnosis is quite high because of this, and the best way to be more certain is to take an antibody test alongside filling out this questionnaire. "
,"If you have taken an antibody test, what was your result?",test,Negative (only the control line),0,"Your negative antibody test result makes it less likely that you have had COVID-19, however these tests do not detect everyone who has had COVID-19 as not everyone develops high levels of antibodies and they can also take up to a few weeks to accumulate after symptoms develop as well fade over time, sometimes within a few months. "
,"If you have taken an antibody test, what was your result?",test,Positive (control + IgG and/or IgM line),1,"Your positive antibody test result makes it much more likely that you have had COVID-19, however these tests do sometimes produce false positives. By answering the other questions in this questionnaire, such as where and when you think you were ill with COVID-19, what symptoms you had, and how long they lasted, this algorithm can increase the certainty of your diagnosis. "
,"If you have taken an antibody test, what was your result?",test,I haven't taken any antibody tests,2,"You didn't take an antibody test, which makes it difficult to predict whether you have had COVID-19. As you will notice, the uncertainty around your diagnosis is quite high because of this, and the best way to be more certain is to take an antibody test alongside filling out this questionnaire. "

,"If applicable, how long after your first symptoms did you take the test?",label_t,Less than 10 days,2-10 days,Less than 10 days is usually too short a time period to wait before getting an antibody test. Taking an antibody test is best done around 3 weeks after symptoms started. 
,"If applicable, how long after your first symptoms did you take the test?",label_t,11-20 days,11-20 days,"Antibody levels usually rise 10 days or so after first COVID symptoms, but they may take longer and so taking an antibody test is best done around 3 weeks after symptoms started. "
,"If applicable, how long after your first symptoms did you take the test?",label_t,21+ days,21+ days,"Waiting 3 weeks from first symptoms to getting an antibody test, as you did, gives your body enough time to produce antibodies in high enough levels to be detectable, however, in many people antibody levels decline after a few months.

,Shortness of breath?,shortnessOfBreath,Yes,1,"<b>Shortness of breath </b> (this is a key feature of COVID-19 caused by the Pneumonia but can also start long after other symptoms have resolved.

If anyone is experiencing shortness of breath on exercise after a few weeks of having no other symptoms we strongly recommend contacting your GP or a physician that specialises in rehabilitation after pneumonia.

,Did anyone else in your household fall ill?,householdIllness,Yes,1,"It is much more likely that you will have had the infection if everyone else you live with had the virus too. But, this does not necessarily mean that those in the same household will all have had symptoms nor does it mean that you will all have antibodies or lasting 'immunity'. If all of you infected only had symptoms for a single period of illness, however long, and have not been re-infected, it is likely you have some degree of immunity, though we do not know how long that will last and it should not change how aware and careful you need to still be about getting or giving the virus to others."
